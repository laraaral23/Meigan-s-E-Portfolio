<strong> Arkin: </strong> A caring, loving, and <i>"palaging nanlilibre"</i> friend who I cherish the most because of his one of a kind personality that gives me comfort even when we don't do anything. I love his personality the most that I couldn't even compare to others because it is really one of a kind. <br> <br>


<strong> Zedrick: </strong> A funny, talkative, and <i>"may saltik" </i> friend that makes us laugh in an instant with his unique humor. I love how strong he is with his life battles and for not giving up easily. <br> <br>


<strong> Reese Nicolette: </strong> A soft-hearted, kind, and <i> "iyakin" </i> friend that likes to talk about anything and reading books is her favorite thing to do! I love her perseverance and dedication in everything that she does. <br> <br>


<strong> Reese Madeline: </strong> A brave, funny, and <i> "palaging namumula ang mukha" </i> friend who I easily got close with in grade 8 and one of my closest friends right now. I love her humor the most because that was the main reason we easily clicked. She's very kind towards me even though she doesn't typically express her feelings.  <br> <br>
